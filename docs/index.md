## The method in 30 seconds

Before you write anything, ask one question: *is this still being decided, already decided, or describing what exists?*

| You are… | Write | When | Can it change? |
|----------|-------|------|----------------|
| Still convincing people | **[RFC](rfc/README.md)** — a proposal | Before building | Yes, while in review. Then it is history. |
| Recording a choice | **[ADR](adr/README.md)** — one decision | The moment you decide | Never. A new ADR supersedes it. |
| Describing the system today | **[arc42](architecture/README.md)** — the map | Continuously | Yes, always kept current. |

They form a chain. Skipping the last step is how documentation rots.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  work["New work"] --> q{"Is the solution<br/>obvious?"}
  q -->|yes| ticket["Ticket"]
  q -->|no| rfc["RFC<br/>propose and review"]
  rfc --> adr["ADR<br/>record each decision"]
  adr --> arc["arc42 + C4<br/>update the map"]
  ticket --> arc
```

## Why

Without this split, every project hits the same three problems:

- **Nobody remembers why.** Six months in, the reason for a choice left with the person who made it. ADRs keep the reason next to the code.
- **The architecture doc is stale.** One big document is too expensive to keep current, so nobody does. arc42 splits it into sections, so you update only the one that changed.
- **The same debate happens twice.** Discussions buried in chat get repeated. An RFC keeps the proposal, the alternatives, and why they lost in one place.

## Three rules

1. **Never edit an accepted ADR.** It is a record of what was true when you decided, like a commit. If the decision changes, write a new ADR and mark the old one `superseded by ADR-NNNN`.
2. **Close the loop.** An implemented RFC is not documentation of the system. Update the arc42 section and the C4 diagram it touched, in the same change.
3. **Skip the RFC when the answer is obvious.** If there are no trade-offs, a ticket is enough. An RFC that only says "here is how we will build it" is overhead.

## See it on a real-looking project

**[CityCycle](https://openmove.github.io/design-docs-example/tour/)** — a fictional bike-sharing service. The [tour](https://openmove.github.io/design-docs-example/tour/) walks the chain and names what each document buys you: a short map at the start, founding ADRs, an RFC that added electric bikes, and a later RFC still in review. Source: [openmove/design-docs-example](https://github.com/openmove/design-docs-example).

CityCycle is a separate repository on purpose. **Use this template** copies every file in this repository. A filled example kept here would land in every new project.

## Start a project

```bash
gh repo create my-project --template openmove/engineering-design-playbook --private
```

Or choose **Use this template** on GitHub.

On day one, fill only this. Leave the other arc42 sections empty until there is something real to write.

1. [Section 1](architecture/01_introduction_and_goals.md) — goals, and the top three quality goals as measurable scenarios
2. [Section 3](architecture/03_context_and_scope.md) and the [context diagram](architecture/diagrams/c4-context.md) — who and what the system talks to
3. [Section 4](architecture/04_solution_strategy.md) — half a page on how the design meets those goals
4. [Section 5](architecture/05_building_block_view.md) and the [container diagram](architecture/diagrams/c4-containers.md) — the deployable pieces
5. The first ADRs — stack, persistence, boundaries, deploy

## What is inside

```text
docs/
  architecture/   arc42 9.0, one file per section, plus C4 diagrams in Mermaid
  adr/            MADR 4.0 templates and ADR 0000 (we use MADR)
  rfc/            RFC template, full and mini
```

The arc42 and MADR files are the official upstream templates, copied in unchanged. Nothing here is a new format. Sources and licenses are in [NOTICES.md](https://github.com/openmove/engineering-design-playbook/blob/main/NOTICES.md).

How each folder works: [architecture](architecture/README.md) · [ADRs](adr/README.md) · [RFCs](rfc/README.md)
